# Deep-learning-based-solution-for-visually-impaired-people
We propose one such development: An object recognition model for wearable object recognition device.  Our algorithm is specialized to recognize items from the produce section of a grocery store. 
resnet model is used for image classification
object detection o.1 is used for object detection
